For my Redial:Telephony class, I’ve attempted to create ways to augment a simple dumbphone with smart phones functionality. I could see this as being useful for those who don’t normally have internet access, those who don’t want the internet with them continuously, and especially for those who don’t have the money to pay for a data plan.

To do this, I connected my gmail to an Asterisk server so one would ostensibly be able to call my Asterisk number and listen to Google Text-to-Speech read back my email. It is mostly working, I just have to mess with some of the timing errors in my Ruby code.

This code assumes you have Asterisk and Ruby gems installed on your server already.
